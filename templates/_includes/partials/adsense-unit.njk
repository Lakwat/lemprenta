{# File: templates/_includes/partials/adsense-unit.njk #}
{#
  This partial represents a single AdSense ad unit.
  You can include this partial wherever you want an ad to appear in your content,
  for example, within a blog post or in a sidebar.

  Remember to replace:
  - 'ca-pub-YOUR_PUB_ID' with your actual AdSense Publisher ID.
  - 'YOUR_AD_SLOT_ID' with the specific Ad Slot ID for this ad unit.
    You'll get this when you create an ad unit in your AdSense account.

  The `style` attribute (e.g., "display:block") and `data-ad-format` 
  can be customized based on the type of ad unit you create in AdSense 
  (e.g., display, in-feed, in-article).
  For responsive ads, "display:block" is common. "data-ad-format="auto"" 
  allows AdSense to automatically size the ad.
#}
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-YOUR_PUB_ID"
     data-ad-slot="YOUR_AD_SLOT_ID"
     data-ad-format="auto"
     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
{#
  Notes:
  - Each <ins> tag should correspond to a unique ad unit you've defined in AdSense,
    each with its own data-ad-slot ID.
  - The (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); script initializes the ad.
    It's safe to call this multiple times on a page if you have multiple ad units.
  - Ensure that the main AdSense script (from adsense-head.njk) is loaded in the <head>
    of your page for these ad units to work.
