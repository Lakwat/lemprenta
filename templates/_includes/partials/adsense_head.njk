{# 
  templates/_includes/partials/adsense-head.njk
  This partial contains the main Google AdSense script.
  It should be included in the <head> of your base layout.
#}

{# 
  IMPORTANT: Replace "ca-pub-YOUR_PUB_ID" with your actual Google AdSense Publisher ID.
  You get this ID when you sign up for AdSense.
  Leaving it as a placeholder will not display ads.

  Optional: If you want to enable AdSense Auto ads, you might place additional
  configuration here or manage it through your AdSense account.
  For now, this is just the basic script required for ad units.
